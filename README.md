## 🧠 Credit Card Recommendation Engine

This repository contains a **funnel-based, explainable credit card recommendation engine** with a two-tier ranking system.  
The engine recommends **up to 7 credit cards** that best match a user’s eligibility, spending behavior, fee preference, and brand affinity.

---

## 🎯 Recommendation Philosophy

The system follows a strict sequence:

1. **Eligibility first** – Can the user get approved?
2. **Relevance next** – Does the card match spending behavior?
3. **User preference** – Fee sensitivity & brand trust
4. **Scoring & ranking** – Explainable weighted scoring
5. **Top 7 output** – Never overwhelming, always relevant

This avoids black-box ML and ensures deterministic, debuggable recommendations.

---

## 🔄 High-Level Flow

The recommendation engine processes data in a linear funnel:

User Profile → Eligibility → Relevance → Preference → Scoring → Top 7 Output

---

## 🧩 Funnel Stages Explained

### ✅ Level 1 – Basic Eligibility
**Question:** _Can this user realistically get approved for the card?_

**Database fields used**
- `Income Requirement`
- `Credit Score Requirement`

Cards failing this stage are permanently removed.

---

### 🎯 Level 2 – Category Relevance
**Question:** _Does the card reward how the user actually spends?_

**Database fields used**
- `Best For Categories`
- `Spending Category`

Cards must achieve **greater than 65% category match** to pass.

---

### 💸 Level 3 – Joining Fee Preference
**Question:** _Is the upfront joining fee acceptable to the user?_

**Database field used**
- `Joining Fee`

Rules:
- `no_fee` → only ₹0 joining fee cards
- `low_fee` → joining fee ≤ ₹1000
- `no_concern` → no restriction

---

## 🏷️ Two-Tier Recommendation System

### Tier 1 – Preferred Brand Cards
If the user selects preferred banks:
- Cards from those banks are ranked first

### Tier 2 – General Cards
If Tier 1 has fewer than 7 cards:
- Best alternatives from other banks are added

This prevents empty results and over-filtering.

---

## 🧮 Scoring & Ranking (Explainable)

Each remaining card is scored using weighted signals.

| Signal | Weight | Database Fields |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Category Match | 30% | Best For Categories, Spending Category |
| Rewards Rate | 20–60% | Base Reward Rate, Optimized Reward Rate |
| Brand Match | up to 50% | Bank |
| Sign-Up Bonus | up to 10% | Sign Up Bonus |

Scores are normalized and cards are ranked in descending order.

---

## 🧠 How Final Ranking is Decided

After cards pass eligibility, relevance, fee preference, and brand selection,
final ranking is calculated using a value-based scoring approach.

The engine considers:
- Lifestyle match (how closely the card matches user spending)
- Reward strength (normalized against other cards)
- Reward achievability (milestone-based rewards are downgraded if unrealistic)
- Cost efficiency (high annual fees reduce score)
- Brand preference (trusted banks get priority when selected)
- Sign-up incentives (minor boost, not dominant)

This ensures premium cards rank high **only if they provide real, achievable value**.

---

## 🚀 How It Works in Code

The engine is executed by passing:
- A list of credit cards from the database
- A normalized user profile

Main entry point:

FunnelRecommendationEngine.processFunnel(allCards, userProfile)

The function returns:
- Filtered cards at each funnel level
- Final ranked recommendations
- Funnel statistics for analytics/debugging

---

## 🧾 Explainability

Each recommendation includes a human-readable explanation, for example:

> “Selected from Preferred Brand Tier based on 82% category match, 5% rewards rate, no joining fee.”

This builds trust and makes the system fully debuggable.

---


## 🎯 Advertised vs Achievable Rewards

Not all rewards are equally achievable.

If a card’s rewards depend on high annual spend milestones and the user’s
spending does not meet those thresholds, the engine adjusts the effective reward score.

This prevents recommending cards that look attractive on paper
but provide limited real-world benefit to the user.

## 📊 Database Field Usage Summary

| Database Field | Usage |
|--------------|------|
| Card Name | Display |
| Bank | Brand filtering & brand score |
| Card Type | UI / future logic |
| Joining Fee | Level 3 filtering & reasoning |
| Annual Fee | Applied as a soft penalty during ranking |
| Credit Score Requirement | Level 1 eligibility |
| Income Requirement | Level 1 eligibility |
| Base Reward Rate | Reward scoring |
| Optimized Reward Rate | Preferred reward scoring |
| Reward Type | Normalizes reward value (cashback > miles > points) |
| Best For Categories | Category matching |
| Min Annual Spend | Used to evaluate reward achievability |
| Milestone Dependency | Determines whether reward downgrade applies |
| Sign Up Bonus | Scoring |
| Features | UI bullets |
| Spending Category | Category matching |

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Constraints

- Reward rates are normalized before scoring
- Category matching is fuzzy and keyword-based
- Scores are relative within a recommendation set
- Maximum of 7 cards are always returned
- Engine is deterministic (same input → same output)


--- 


## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Penalize high annual fee cards
- Reward milestone-achievable cards
- Add “Why this card was not recommended”
- Introduce tunable scoring weights
